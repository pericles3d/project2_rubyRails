##Project 2: World Cup poll
####Overview

I have a group of friends who organize a huge poll for the World Cup when it happens. Each person receives an excell spreadsheet and fills out with their guesses for each game score for every game in the tournament. According to the scores you pick, your teams will advance to the next rounds and you keeppicking scores. There is a whole systme for calculating points for each score and winner you get right. At the end, the person with more points wins the poll and receives a prize.

It's a lot of fun, but the main issue with it is that it's not online. We get a daily update of how everyone is doing with new excel spreadsheets.

I want to build an online app that will allow every person to create a login, fill out their guesses for each game online and be able to view all sorts of data of how others are doing and compare yourself to them.
